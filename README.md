# GraphQL Apollo Client Project 

This project uses react with Apollo client. It sends queries to graphQL Apollo server on this [repo](https://github.com/sittimunirahar/graphql-server-app).

## Setup
To setup and run this project:

1. `git clone` this repo
2. `cd`
3. run `npm install`
4. run `node --watch index.js` or `npm run dev`

Don't forget to run REST API json server from the server repo and the graphQL server: https://github.com/sittimunirahar/graphql-server-app

### Once all three servers are running, the UI should look like this:
